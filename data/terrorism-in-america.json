The NSA alerted the CIA, which worked its sources on the ground and confirmed the presence of an American in Pakistan's tribal regions. That intelligence was taken to the Joint Terrorism Task Force in New York, where travel records and customs information were used, along with Pakistani records, to track Americans who had arrived in Pakistan.

According to the government's sentencing memo, citing the interrogation of Suffian, El-Hanafi provided 'The Doctor' with a total of about $67,000, in addition to remote control devices, outerwear and boots, and three GPS devices.

The FBI then initiated an investigation and found that the number belonged to Moalin. In December 2007, it began intercepting Moalin's phone calls. The government charged Moalin and three others '“ Issa Doreh, a worker at a money-transmitting business that was the conduit for moving the funds; Mohamed Mohamed Mohamud, the imam at a mosque frequented by San Diego's immigrant Somali community; and Ahmed Nasiri Taalil Mohamud, a cabdriver from Anaheim, Calif. '“ with conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Together, they provided just under $8,500 to al-Shabaab. According to court filings, Moalin's lawyer, Joshua Dratel, said in December 2011 that a year's worth of Moalin's phone calls were intercepted by the government, 1,800 of which were turned over to the defense for trial preparation. Prosecutors also turned over 680 pages of Moalin's email traffic.</p><p>Interestingly, an investigation of Moalin had been opened in 2003 when the FBI suspected him of having terrorist links.

'If you see anything today, can you give us a shout? We're extremely interested in getting real time info (location/new #s) on Ayrow.' Three months later, Ayrow was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Another FBI email discussed how NSA surveillance of Moalin allowed the United States to pinpoint Ayrow's location and target him for the strike.

James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, asserted during an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on June 10, 2013, that NSA surveillance helped stop Headley's planned attack on the Danish newspaper. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, also counted Headley's capture a success for Section 215 during an interview on ABC the day before.</p><p>While government officials have argued that the Headley case is an example of successful NSA bulk surveillance, there is reason to believe that the initial tip may have come from British intelligence, which was monitoring a group of extremists in the United Kingdom with whom Headley made contact. During an interrogation conducted by Indian government officials in 2010, while Headley was in U.S. custody, Headley described how he met with Basharat and Sufiyaan, two Pakistani men who were affiliated with al-Qaeda, in Derby, England, in July 2009 and received an undisclosed amount of money from them for the attack on Jyllands-Posten. ProPublica has reported that U.S. government surveillance was implemented only after a tip from the British about this meeting. Headley's interrogation by the Indians also supports this conclusion.</p><p>Officials in Clapper's office have said only that information lawfully gathered under FISA was integral to disrupting the attack in Denmark, but this does not rule out other sources of information at other points in the investigation. The NSA's surveillance programs may still have been involved, as it appears that the British tip was the result of a communications intercept, and the NSA and GCHQ, Britain's signals intelligence agency, are known to cooperate. But as the individuals Headley contacted were already under British surveillance, an NSA role would not provide support for the bulk surveillance programs, but rather for more traditional intelligence work.</p><p>The Headley case doesn't seem to have been initiated by the NSA, but rather from a tip provided by British intelligence, which in turn alerted the FBI. While NSA bulk communications surveillance does seem to have been helpful in building the case against Headley, it does not seem to have been critical. Headley was in contact with known al-Qaeda associates in Britain and was a longtime member of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a known Pakistani terrorist group, something that had been flagged repeatedly to U.S. law enforcement authorities. </p><p>In January 2009, Headley made a reconnaissance trip to Copenhagen to plot an attack on Jyllands-Posten on behalf of Lashkar-e-Taiba. Headley returned to Pakistan to meet with his handlers, only to find out that the plot was to be sidelined, so he took his intelligence and pitched the idea of an attack to his al-Qaeda contact, Illyas Kashmiri. Kashmiri gave him the names of militants in Britain, Basharat (Passha) and Sufiyaan (Simon), and in Sweden (Farid) who could help him with funds and weapons. While Headley was in Chicago during the summer of 2009 and preparing for a second reconnaissance trip to Denmark, he communicated with the two operatives in Britain.</p><p>British intelligence found out about Headley's upcoming visit and notified the FBI that a suspect was in contact with British militants. The FBI then alerted U.S. Customs and Border Protection about a suspect and asked for help in identifying him. U.S. authorities were able to identify Headley using information regarding his flight plans and coordinated with European counterterrorism officials to track his next moves, from Derby on July 26 to Stockholm to Copenhagen on July 31. Headley flew back to the United States on August 5, stopping in Atlanta, and was questioned by airport security before being released so the FBI could continue to follow him. Shortly before his arrest, his phone calls to family members were also being intercepted, and the NSA retrieved previous communications to help build the case against him. The entire effort lasted over two months until Headley was finally arrested on October 9, 2009, at Chicago O'Hare International Airport as he tried to depart for Pakistan.</p><p>Importantly, Headley could have been stopped at any time after the 9/11 attacks as his militant activities were repeatedly flagged to U.S. authorities, but, inexplicably it seems, Headley kept evading serious law enforcement scrutiny. Following the 9/11 attacks, U.S. authorities received tips regarding Headley's terrorist activity at least five times from his family members, friends, and acquaintances. The first tip was given by Terry O'Donnell, a bartender who alerted authorities in the weeks following 9/11 about Headley's extremist comments praising the attacks and his ties with Pakistan. As a result, two government officials interrogated Headley on October 4, 2001. He denied the accusations and cited his current cooperation with Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents, who were also present at the interrogation, as an informant for drug smuggling.</p><p>In the summer of 2002, authorities received another call regarding Headley's suspicious behavior, which included telling his mother he was training at terrorist camps, from a friend of his mother. The FBI office in Philadelphia that received the call did a basic record check and closed the case without ever interviewing Headley, his mother, or his mother's friend.</p><p>In the summer of 2005, Headley was arrested after he assaulted one of his wives (he was married to different women at the same time) in Manhattan; his wife also called a terrorism tip line. Agents from the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force interviewed her three times, and she told them about Headley's extremist activities. The FBI knew about the previous allegations of extremism and ties to militant groups, but still closed the case without ever questioning Headley. The assault charges were also dropped.</p><p>In late 2007 and early 2008, Headley's then-wife, Faiza Outalha, reported him to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad. She was interviewed by State Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents multiple times. U.S. officials said her warnings were not specific enough to warrant any further investigation, though the State Department says it did communicate her warnings to the CIA, FBI, and DEA.</p><p>Following the 2008 Mumbai attacks, another of Headley's mother's friends informed the FBI that he might have been involved. FBI agents interviewed her on December 1, 2008. She told them that Headley was still involved in militant activity and, according to a U.S. law enforcement official, the FBI agents found the records and warnings about Headley dating back to 2001. On December 21, 2008, FBI agents interviewed Farid Gilani, Headley's cousin in Philadelphia, who told them Headley was in Pakistan (he was actually in Chicago). While the agents put the inquiry on hold since they believed Headley was abroad, their efforts show that conventional law enforcement techniques could have detected him almost a decade before he was arrested.</p>","foreign_attack":"FALSE","victims_wounded":"0","victims_killed":"0","year":"2009","deadly_attack_date":null,"plot_status":"Prevented","method_of_prevention":"NSA surveillance targeting non-U.S. persons under Section 702","ideology":"Jihadist","legal_1":null,"legal_2":null,"legal_3":null,"legal_4":null,"legal_5":null,"legal_6":null,"array_legal":null,"source_1":"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-sen-dianne-feinstein-rep-mike-rogers/story?id=19343314&amp;singlePage=true","source_2":"http://www.propublica.org/article/defenders-of-nsa-surveillance-web-omit-most-of-mumbai-plotters-story","source_3":"http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/surveillance-timeline","source_4":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6654177/British-tip-off-led-to-arrest-of-US-Mumbai-suspect-David-Headley.html","source_5":"http://www.propublica.org/article/david-headley-homegrown-terrorist","source_6":null,"source_7":null,"array_sources":"\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-sen-dianne-feinstein-rep-mike-rogers/story?id=19343314&amp;singlePage=true\",\"http://www.propublica.org/article/defenders-of-nsa-surveillance-web-omit-most-of-mumbai-plotters-story\",\"http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/surveillance-timeline\",\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6654177/British-tip-off-led-to-arrest-of-US-Mumbai-suspect-David-Headley.html\",\"http://www.propublica.org/article/david-headley-homegrown-terrorist\"","_id_depreciated":"60","id_2_depreciated":"1583","plot_initiation":null},{"plot_ID":"48","name":"2013 Nabi and Alsarabbi","description":"<p>Humayoun Ghoulan Nabi and Ismail Alsarabbi were charged on October 10, 2013, with conspiring to provide aid, in the form of outerwear and electronics, to the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.

Anonymous government officials have suggested that he was initially discovered through an NSA operation, but his father also provided a tip to the FBI in August 2009, raising questions about whether the NSA initiated the investigation and whether it would have occurred regardless of the NSA's involvement. The government has not officially claimed the case as an NSA success.</p><p>Whichever method sparked the investigation, an informant and undercover employees were used to assess Mohamud and conduct a sting operation in which Mohamud planned to attack the local Christmas tree lighting ceremony. Though the case can be considered a form of an attack plot, it is distinctly different from some of the other plots because it was organized under the eyes of undercover agents. However, Mohamud's connections to Amro al-Ali, a suspected terrorist from Saudi Arabia, and Samir Khan, a U.S. citizen who published Inspire, an al-Qaeda propaganda magazine, caution against dismissing the plot as something that would not have occurred but for the government's involvement. </p><p>According to a senior counterterrorism official interviewed by Marc Ambinder, a national security reporter, the FBI was first alerted to Mohamud by an NSA operation in Somalia. The New York Times reported a similar explanation, tracing the beginning of Mohamud's monitoring to the interception of his emails with an extremist, citing an anonymous law enforcement official. Based on court documents that extremist can be identified as Ali.</p><p>Ali is a Saudi national who lived in Portland from 2007 to 2008, and was a wanted international terrorist for whom an Interpol Red Notice was issued on October 18, 2009; he is now believed to be in prison in Saudi Arabia. He is referred to in many of the court documents as 'Unindicted Associate 1' or 'UA1.'</p><p>According to the criminal complaint, court-authorized surveillance showed that Mohamud was in contact with Ali in August 2009. On August 31, 2009, Ali forwarded to Mohamud an email link regarding a religious school in Yemen. While email intercepts may have triggered the investigation, there is also an alternative explanation. The same day Ali sent the email about the religious school, Mohamud's father called the FBI office in Portland and said he was worried about his son's jihadist leanings. The call led to an in-person meeting between Mohamud's father and FBI Special Agent Isaac Delong.</p><p>On November 9, a confidential FBI source contacted Mohamud by email to help the FBI assess him, and by the time they last communicated in August 2010, they had exchanged 44 emails, though they never met in person or talked over the phone.</p><p>About three weeks after the source contacted Mohamud, Ali contacted Mohamud from northwest Pakistan. In a December 3, 2009, email to Mohamud, Ali said he was on a pilgrimage to Mecca, but a review of the IP address, a numerical label that identifies where a device connected to the Internet is located, showed that the email was sent from Pakistan's tribal regions. It is believed that the email notified Mohamud that Ali had successfully engaged in terrorist activity.</p><p>In emails from Pakistan, Ali discussed Mohamud joining terrorist activity abroad using coded language and provided instructions for Mohamud to contact another extremist, Abulhadi (UA2), to coordinate the plan. Beginning on December 12, 2009, Mohamud attempted to contact UA2, as UA1 instructed, but his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.</p><p>On June 14, 2010, Mohamud was stopped at Portland International Airport while trying to fly to Kodiak, Alaska, and was interviewed by the FBI. Later that month, an undercover FBI employee (UCE1) contacted Mohamud and said he was affiliated with UA1. Mohamud responded to the agent's email and agreed to meet with the employee in Portland on July 30, 2010 '“ thus beginning an undercover operation.</p><p>On August 19, 2010, Mohamud met with UCE1 again and was introduced to a second FBI undercover agent (UCE2). During the meeting, Mohamud identified the Portland Christmas tree lighting ceremony as a potential target.</p><p>On September 7, 2010, UCE1, UCE2, and Mohamud met again and the undercover employees asked Mohamud to buy bomb components, send them to UCE1, and find a place to park the bomb. Mohamud agreed. On November 26, 2010, Mohamud was arrested as he tried to detonate the fake bomb.</p><p>Mohamud was sentenced to 30 years.</p>","foreign_attack":"FALSE","victims_wounded":"0","victims_killed":"0","year":"2010","deadly_attack_date":null,"plot_status":"Prevented","method_of_prevention":"NSA surveillance under an unknown authority","ideology":"Jihadist","legal_1":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/1548/Complaint - Mohamud.pdf","legal_2":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/1548/FISA Notice - Mohamud.pdf","legal_3":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/1548/Mohamud - Government Trial Memorandum.pdf","legal_4":null,"legal_5":null,"legal_6":null,"array_legal":"\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/1548/Complaint - Mohamud.pdf\",\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/1548/FISA Notice - Mohamud.pdf\",\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/1548/Mohamud - Government Trial Memorandum.pdf\"","source_1":"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/us/28portland.html?_r=4&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all","source_2":"http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/crime/2014/10/01/oregon-man-gets-30-years-in-portland-christmas-bomb-plot/16541361/","source_3":null,"source_4":null,"source_5":null,"source_6":null,"source_7":null,"array_sources":"\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/us/28portland.html?_r=4&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all\",\"http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/crime/2014/10/01/oregon-man-gets-30-years-in-portland-christmas-bomb-plot/16541361/\"","_id_depreciated":"25","id_2_depreciated":"1548","plot_initiation":null},{"plot_ID":"69","name":"2009 Betim Kaziu","description":"<p>In February 2009, Betim Kaziu, a U.S. citizen and resident of Brooklyn, New York, traveled to Cairo, Egypt, from the United States to wage violent jihad against U.S. troops in the Middle East and the Balkans.

John Miller, the Deputy NYPD Commissioner stated that Thompson had been, 'visiting websites that are focused on designated terrorist groups -- al-Qaida, ISIS and al-Shabaab -- as well as looking at different acts of violence' and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton told a news conference, 'This was a terrorist act.' Police, however, have noted that they believe Thompson self-radicalized and lack ties to organized terrorist groups.</p>","foreign_attack":"FALSE","victims_wounded":"2","victims_killed":"0","year":"2014","deadly_attack_date":null,"plot_status":"Not prevented prior to incident","method_of_prevention":"Not prevented prior to incident","ideology":"Jihadist","legal_1":null,"legal_2":null,"legal_3":null,"legal_4":null,"legal_5":null,"legal_6":null,"array_legal":null,"source_1":"http://news.yahoo.com/man-islamic-extremist-leanings-attacks-ny-police-083342808.html","source_2":"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/motive-sought-in-hatchet-attack-on-nypd-officers/","source_3":"http://abcnews.go.com/US/nyc-ax-attacker-consumed-desire-strike-us-authority/story?id=26664787","source_4":"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/man-who-attacked-police-with-hatchet-ranted-about-us-officials-say.html?_r=0","source_5":"http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/23/us/new-york-police-attacked/","source_6":null,"source_7":null,"array_sources":"\"http://news.yahoo.com/man-islamic-extremist-leanings-attacks-ny-police-083342808.html\",\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/motive-sought-in-hatchet-attack-on-nypd-officers/\",\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/nyc-ax-attacker-consumed-desire-strike-us-authority/story?id=26664787\",\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/man-who-attacked-police-with-hatchet-ranted-about-us-officials-say.html?_r=0\",\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/23/us/new-york-police-attacked/\"","_id_depreciated":"148","id_2_depreciated":"1801","plot_initiation":"Initiated by individuals"},{"plot_ID":"102","name":"2010 Abdel Shehadeh","description":"<p>Abdel Hamid Shehadeh, a Staten Island man, was convicted of making false statements regarding a trip he made to Pakistan and sentenced to 13 years (with the two sentences being concurrent resulting in 8 years of prison).

Juraboev and Saidakhmetov allegedly tried to travel to join ISIS in Syria while Habibov allegedly funded the enterprise. Saidakhmetov and Juraboev allegedly also discussed a variety of possible attacks in the United States if they were unable to travel overseas. However, there is no public evidence these plots moved beyond talk and news reports citing officials suggest they were aspirational rather than operational.

The bulk collection of telephone metadata did not play an appreciable role in the prevention of the attack. There is no evidence that the NSA program used to help investigate the plot was critical for counterterrorism efforts, as the plot could have been prevented through the use of traditional, targeted criminal or FISA warrants.</p><p>On September 6, 2009, Zazi exchanged emails with a Pakistan-based email address in which he asked about the correct amounts of chemicals needed to produce a bomb. According to the statements of various government officials, the NSA intercepted this email and passed the information on to the FBI. The next day, the FBI opened a full investigation. (According to Associated Press reporter Matt Apuzzo, there is no evidence that the Pakistani state or intelligence services knew of Zazi and his conspirators.)</p><p>However, the surveillance of the email address that led to Zazi's arrest did not rely on bulk collection of phone and email metadata. The email address was known to belong to an al-Qaeda figure for at least five months prior to the NSA's interception of Zazi's email as a result of a British operation in April 2009. On April 8, 2009, Britain's North-West Counter-Terrorism Unit, along with local police forces, arrested 12 people in 'Operation Pathway.' Abid Naseer, one of the men who was arrested and had been under surveillance, was in contact with the same email address between November 30, 2008, and April 3, 2009. On April 3, Naseer sent an encoded email, triggering greater attention from the British security services, who assessed that the email belonged to an al-Qaeda associate and was a sign of an impending attack.</p><p>The British shared their findings with the United States, enabling the NSA's surveillance of the email address. In the immediate wake of Zazi's arrest, the British press made clear the key role that Operation Pathway played in initiating the surveillance.</p><p>This all suggests that the plot could have been prevented through traditional individualized FISA warrants without the expanded authorities that govern the NSA surveillance programs. The knowledge that the email address was that of an al-Qaeda associate would have been sufficient to obtain a warrant for the email's contents. However, while the expanded authorities do not appear to have been necessary, the NSA did play a role. The case could not have been cracked without surveilling the al-Qaeda fixer's email address. It is also conceivable that the NSA's expanded surveillance capabilities played a key role in the Operation Pathway investigation, as GCHQ and NSA, as we noted previously, share information.</p><p>The extent of the publicly cited importance of the NSA's collection of American telephone metadata under Section 215 in the Zazi case appears to be the identification of an additional phone number for an individual who was already under suspicion. Once the FBI identified a phone number included in Zazi's email as belonging to the individual, the NSA checked the number against telephone metadata collected under the authority. The agency's examination of this metadata provided a previously unknown phone number for Adis Medunjanin, one of Zazi's co-conspirators, in New York City. However, Medunjanin was already known to the FBI as a person of interest. Indeed, according to the AP's Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman, who reported on the case, the first FBI examination of travel records noted that Zazi likely traveled to Pakistan with Medunjanin and Ahmedzay.</p><p>Moreover, the FBI itself is capable of obtaining phone records of suspects as part of specific investigations, rather than relying upon bulk collection. According to investigative reporters Apuzzo and Goldman, 'one of the first things the FBI did when investigating Zazi was to obtain a national security letter for his phone records and those of his friends and family.' The FBI made widespread use of 'national security' and 'imminent threat of death' letters to monitor Zazi's associates, who were also under 24-hour surveillance, using wiretaps under FISA warrants. These factors suggest that, in foiling the New York City subway plot, the contribution of the NSA's bulk collection of American telephone metadata was minimal at best.</p><p>On April 2, 2015, the United States unsealed an indictment charging Muhanad Mahmoud al Farekh, an American citizen, with conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. Farekh allegedly left to fight in Pakistan with Ferhid Imam, who was charged in relation to the plot by Najibullah Zazi and his co-conspirators to bomb the New York City subway. Details surrounding Farekh's activity are sparse and the initial lead that led the government to identify him is unclear.</p>","foreign_attack":"FALSE","victims_wounded":"0","victims_killed":"0","year":"2009","deadly_attack_date":null,"plot_status":"Prevented","method_of_prevention":"NSA surveillance targeting non-U.S. persons under Section 702","ideology":"Jihadist","legal_1":null,"legal_2":null,"legal_3":null,"legal_4":null,"legal_5":null,"legal_6":null,"array_legal":null,"source_1":"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/events/2013/10/10%20nsa%20zazi/20131010_nsa_surveillance_programs_transcript.pdf","source_2":"http://www.siac.tribunals.gov.uk/Documents/outcomes/1_OpenJudgment.pdf","source_3":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6529436/British-spies-help-prevent-al-Qaeda-inspired-attack-on-New-York-subway.html","source_4":"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/nyc-bomb-plot-details-settle-little-nsa-debate","source_5":"http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/50attacks.pdf","source_6":"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/american-citizen-charged-conspiring-provide-material-support-terrorists","source_7":null,"array_sources":"\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/events/2013/10/10%20nsa%20zazi/20131010_nsa_surveillance_programs_transcript.pdf\",\"http://www.siac.tribunals.gov.uk/Documents/outcomes/1_OpenJudgment.pdf\",\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6529436/British-spies-help-prevent-al-Qaeda-inspired-attack-on-New-York-subway.html\",\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/nyc-bomb-plot-details-settle-little-nsa-debate\",\"http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/50attacks.pdf\",\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/american-citizen-charged-conspiring-provide-material-support-terrorists\"","_id_depreciated":"20","id_2_depreciated":"1543","plot_initiation":null},{"plot_ID":"128","name":"2015 Keonna Thomas","description":"On April 3, 2015 the United States announced charges against Keonna Thomas, a 30-year old woman from Philadelphia, alleging that she attempted to provide support to ISIS by seeking to travel to join the group in Syria.

According to the complaint, Saleh, a student specializing in aeronautics, had expressed jihadist views, sought to construct an explosive device, and offered his services in translating ISIS propaganda. Saleh and a co-conspirator allegedly attempted to attack law enforcement officials who were conducting surveillance on them. The investigation into Saleh appears to have been initiated in March 2015 when a Port Authority police officer observed him on the George Washington Bridge two days in a row and brought him back to the Port Authority office after which he was interviewed by members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. An unnamed 17-year-old was arrested along with Saleh and faces state charges in Queens - the 17 year old was later named as Imran Rabbani.\nOn June 17, Fareed Mumuni, a 21-year-old U.S. citizen and resident of Staten Island was arrested after allegedly attempting to stab an FBI Special Agent who was executing a search warrant at his residence. The complaint alleges that Mumuni had conspired with Saleh and others to provide material support to ISIS and assisted Saleh in his plot to conduct a terrorist attack. Mumuni appears to have been discovered as part of the investigation into Saleh.\nOn June 18, 2015 the United States filed a criminal complaint charging Samuel Rahamin Topaz, a 21-year-old citizen of the United States living in Fort Lee, New Jersey with conspiring to provide material support to ISIS. On June 29, 2015 the United States arrested Alaa Saadeh, a 23-year-old citizen of the United States and resident of New Jersey. The complaint against Saadeh alleges that he conspired with his brother and Samuel Topaz as part of a plan to travel to join ISIS. According to the complaint Saadeh's brother, who is not named or charged in the complaint, successfully traveled to Jordan where he was arrested. \nThe investigation into Topaz and Saadeh appears to have begun with a series of tips from the community. On January 17, 2015 an individual identified as 'Individual 3' and described as having 'maintained a personal relationship with Topaz for several years' advised the FBI that he or she was worried about Topaz 'because of '˜what is going on overseas'' and mentioned two friends of Topaz's who he could not name but were later identified as Saadeh and Saadeh's brother. Individual 3 continued to provide information to the FBI including telling the FBI on April 15, 2015 that Saadeh's brother and another conspirator were trying to recruit him. Another tip came on April 27, 2015 when an individual identified as 'Individual 1' contacted the FBI to tell them that Saadeh's brother, Saadeh, and Topaz might be planning to travel overseas to join ISIS. Individual 1 was roommates at various times with Saadeh and Saadeh's brother.\nThe complaints in the Topaz and Saadeh cases refer to another co-conspirator, 'Co-Conspirator 2,' who was allegedly involved in the conspiracy and present when Saadeh's brother went to the airport to fly to Jordan. The co-conspirator who is not named in the documents is described as 'a resident of Queens, New York, until he was arrested on June 12, 2015 in New York on terrorism charges' and as a 20-year-old citizen of the United States matching the characteristics of Munther Saleh. The complaints against Saadeh and Topaz do not mention the alleged plot by Saleh to build an explosive device.\nOn August 1, 2015 the United States filed a complaint against Nader Saadeh, identifying him as Alaa Saadeh's brother, and accusing him of conspiracy and attempting to provide material support to ISIS - specifically his trip to Jordan allegedly to try and join the group. Saadeh was arrested on Aug. 10 after returning to the United States.","foreign_attack":"FALSE","victims_wounded":"0","victims_killed":"0","year":"2015","deadly_attack_date":null,"plot_status":"Prevented","method_of_prevention":"Community/family tip","ideology":"Jihadist","legal_1":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/2034410031/Criminal Complaint - Alaa Saadeh.pdf","legal_2":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/2034410031/Criminal Complaint - Fareed Mumuni.pdf","legal_3":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/2034410031/Criminal Complaint - Munther Saleh.pdf","legal_4":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/2034410031/Criminal Complaint - Samuel Topaz.pdf","legal_5":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/2034410031/Criminal Complaint - Nader Saadeh.pdf","legal_6":null,"array_legal":"\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/2034410031/Criminal Complaint - Alaa Saadeh.pdf\",\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/2034410031/Criminal Complaint - Fareed Mumuni.pdf\",\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/2034410031/Criminal Complaint - Munther Saleh.pdf\",\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/2034410031/Criminal Complaint - Samuel Topaz.pdf\",\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newamerica.org/securitydata/attachments/terrorplots/2034410031/Criminal Complaint - Nader Saadeh.pdf\"","source_1":"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/06/16/queens-college-student-terror-plot-nyc/","source_2":"http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Terror-Arrest-New-Jersey-ISIS-Law-Enforcement-Suspect-Police-FBI-Citizen-Death-Charge-310684461.html","source_3":"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/dad-defends-queens-college-student-accused-isis-plot-article-1.2260994","source_4":"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/29/us-usa-security-idUSKCN0P925F20150629","source_5":"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-jersey-man-charged-conspiracy-provide-material-support-isil-and-witnes","source_6":null,"source_7":null,"array_sources":"\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/06/16/queens-college-student-terror-plot-nyc/\",\"http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Terror-Arrest-New-Jersey-ISIS-Law-Enforcement-Suspect-Police-FBI-Citizen-Death-Charge-310684461.html\",\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/dad-defends-queens-college-student-accused-isis-plot-article-1.2260994\",\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/29/us-usa-security-idUSKCN0P925F20150629\",\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-jersey-man-charged-conspiracy-provide-material-support-isil-and-witnes\"","_id_depreciated":"181","id_2_depreciated":"2034410031","plot_initiation":"Initiated by individuals"},{"plot_ID":"174","name":"2015 Colorado Planned Parenthood Shooting","description":"On November 27, 2015, Robert Dear was arrested in Colorado Springs, Colorado following a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic that left three people dead and nine others wounded.

Farook worked at the department.\n \n Anonymous law enforcement officials told multiple outlets that the couple had links to multiple individuals being investigated for terrorism and was in touch with them via social media including one who was overseas. CNN has reported that a law enforcement official told them that Tashfeen Malik had posted a pledge of allegiance to ISIS on Facebook the day of the attack though they did not explain how they knew it was her posting. The couple reportedly had a large cache of ammunition, twelve pipebombs, and materials for making pipebombs at their apartment. According to the New York Times, the FBI is treating the case as a terrorism case based on the links to people under investigation in Islamist extremist terrorism cases and the weapons cache. However, a senior law enforcement official told The Washington Post that the couples' contacts with extremists 'were not substantial contacts' and were in some cases years old continuing: 'Those contacts would not have put him on our radar.

A pipe bomb exploded on the morning of September 17 near the route of a Marine Corps 5k charity race in Seaside Park, New Jersey. That same evening, security video documented an individual – allegedly Ahman Khan Rahami – wheeling one duffel bag at two separate locations in New York City, West 23rd Street and West 27th Street. A device on West 23rd Street exploded near a dumpster around 8:30pm and injured 29 individuals, while the device on West 27th Street, found at roughly 11:30pm, did not explode. A cell phone attached to the device on West 27th Street contained Rahami’s fingerprints. Both devices were filled with shrapnel and built using pressure cookers, flip phones, and Christmas lights. At roughly 8:45pm on September 18, 2016, a backpack filled with five pipe bombs was discovered on top of a trash receptacle near a train station in Elizabeth, N.J., also the town in which Rahami supposedly lives and works. Rahami was found sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, N.J. – 12 miles south of Elizabeth – on the morning of September 19. After being found by officials – due to a tip from the bar owner – and asked to show his hands, Rahami engaged in a shootout with local law enforcement before being detained. Two officers were reportedly injured. In 2014, in connection with a domestic violence charge involving Rahami and one of his brothers, his father, Mohammad Rahami, told the FBI that his son might be a terrorist. The FBI conducted a brief investigation but found nothing to substantiate the father's claim. On October 13, Mr. Rahami, connected via video conference to the courtroom in Elizabeth, NJ from his hospital bed, pled not guilty. <p>","foreign_attack":"FALSE","victims_wounded":"31","victims_killed":"0","year":"2016","deadly_attack_date":"September 17, 2016","plot_status":"Not prevented prior to incident","method_of_prevention":"Not prevented prior to incident","ideology":"Jihadist","legal_1":null,"legal_2":null,"legal_3":null,"legal_4":null,"legal_5":null,"legal_6":null,"array_legal":null,"source_1":"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/us/new-york-explosion-investigation/","source_2":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahami-bombing-suspect.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news","source_3":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahami-suspect.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur","source_4":"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ny-nj-bombings/chelsea-bombing-suspect-ahmad-khan-rahami-left-behind-rambling-note-n651171","source_5":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahami-suspect.html","source_6":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahamis-youtube-account-included-jihad-videos-complaint-says.html?_r=0","source_7":null,"array_sources":"\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/us/new-york-explosion-investigation/\",\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahami-bombing-suspect.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news\",\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahami-suspect.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur\",\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ny-nj-bombings/chelsea-bombing-suspect-ahmad-khan-rahami-left-behind-rambling-note-n651171\",\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahami-suspect.html\",\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahamis-youtube-account-included-jihad-videos-complaint-says.html?_r=0\"","_id_depreciated":null,"id_2_depreciated":null,"plot_initiation":null},{"plot_ID":"194","name":"2016 Adnan Fazeli","description":null,"foreign_attack":"FALSE","victims_wounded":"0","victims_killed":"0","year":"2016","deadly_attack_date":null,"plot_status":"Prevented","method_of_prevention":null,"ideology":"Jihadist","legal_1":"http://www.pressherald.com/2016/08/16/documents-freeport-man-died-fighting-for-islamic-state/document/","legal_2":null,"legal_3":null,"legal_4":null,"legal_5":null,"legal_6":null,"array_legal":"\"http://www.pressherald.com/2016/08/16/documents-freeport-man-died-fighting-for-islamic-state/document/\"","source_1":null,"source_2":null,"source_3":null,"source_4":null,"source_5":null,"source_6":null,"source_7":null,"array_sources":null,"_id_depreciated":null,"id_2_depreciated":null,"plot_initiation":null},{"plot_ID":"195","name":"2016 St. Cloud Mall Stabbing","description":"<p>On September 17, 2016, Dahir A.

According to a statement from the Khan family, Mahin Khan “went through an extensive inpatient psychiatric evaluation under the directive and supervision of the FBI” three years ago, according to The Intercept. The Khan family referenced Mahin Khan’s severe mental health issues, making reference to his unconfirmed autism and his immature and underdeveloped cognitive abilities. Mr. Khan’s mental health did not factor in to his ability to stand trial. The charges brought against Mr. Khan reference his support of and potential contact with ISIS and the Pakistani Taliban, in addition to his plotting of attacking Air Force recruitment centers in Tucson and Mission Bay, Calif. Records also indicate Mr. Khan’s interest in attacking a Department of Motor Vehicles registration office and a Jewish community center. Mr. Khan’s sentencing will occur on November 4.<p>","foreign_attack":"FALSE","victims_wounded":"0","victims_killed":"0","year":"2016","deadly_attack_date":null,"plot_status":"Prevented","method_of_prevention":"Community/family tip","ideology":"Jihadist","legal_1":"https://www.azag.gov/sites/default/files/sites/all/docs/press-release/press-release-files/Khan_Indictment.pdf","legal_2":null,"legal_3":null,"legal_4":null,"legal_5":null,"legal_6":null,"array_legal":null,"source_1":"http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/arizona-man-accused-terrorism-plea-guilty-42710347","source_2":"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/03/18-year-old-arrested-on-terrorism-charges-is-mentally-like-a-child/","source_3":null,"source_4":null,"source_5":null,"source_6":null,"source_7":null,"array_sources":null,"_id_depreciated":null,"id_2_depreciated":null,"plot_initiation":null},{"plot_ID":"203","name":"2016 Ludke and Padilla-Conde","description":"<p>On October 14, 2016, Jason Michael Ludke, 35, and Yosvany Padilla-Conde, 30, were detained near San Angelo, Tex. where they were believed to be en route from Wisconsin to Mexico to attempt to travel to join ISIS in Iraq and Syria, or Yemen.
